Since v1.4.0 Locative supports the use of iBeacons as Geofences.

The feature set is pretty the same as with geographical Geofences, this App can be used with any Bluetooth 4.0 (LE) iDevice to advertise as am iBeacon.

When using Locative, the iBeacons UUID must be entered when adding an iBeacon, the Sample App's UUID defaults to **954FBC91-620E-4B5A-86F7-1F31A0054194**

To use the Sample project, simply check out this Repo open the **GFBeacon.xcodeproj** and hit run.

For more info about **Locative** check out [http://locative.io](http://locative.io) or get it in the App Store at [http://get.locative.io](http://get.locative.io).

There's also another neat little feature which will gain more attention in the near future. Locative features a Geofence-Logging as-a-service at [https://my.locative.io](https://my.locative.io). So check it out and grab yourself an account ;-)
